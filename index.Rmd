# Why is it ideal for Cities?

### 1. Open Access Data
Unlike commercial satellites (e.g., WorldView), Sentinel-2 data is **free and open**. This reduces costs for long-term urban planning projects.

### 2. The "Red Edge" Bands
Sentinel-2 is unique because it includes specific bands in the "Red Edge" spectrum.

> **Application:** This is crucial for monitoring urban vegetation health (Chlorophyll content) and differentiating between parks, gardens, and concrete structures.

# Case Study: Urban Heat & Green Space

.pull-left[
### The Problem
Cities suffer from the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect.

### The Solution
Using Sentinel-2's **Near-Infrared (NIR)** channel (Band 8) and **Red** channel (Band 4), we can calculate **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).

$$NDVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}$$

# Limitations & Reflections

[cite_start]Although Sentinel-2 is powerful, we must acknowledge constraints (as discussed in lecture [cite: 543]):

* **Cloud Cover:** As a **passive sensor**, it cannot see through clouds. [cite_start]In regions like the UK, obtaining a cloud-free image can be difficult in winter[cite: 544].
* **Spatial Resolution (10m):** While good for general zoning, it is not detailed enough to identify individual small cars or street furniture compared to 30cm commercial drone data.

**Conclusion:** For broad-scale urban temporal analysis, Sentinel-2 offers the best balance of cost, coverage, and revisit time.
